# Music Recommendation System

## Overview
This project is a **Music Recommendation System** developed in Python, aimed at delivering song suggestions based on user preferences and listening patterns. Using a machine learning model trained on a curated song dataset, it provides personalized music recommendations tailored to individual user profiles.

## Project Structure
- **`model training.ipynb`**: A Jupyter Notebook that details the entire process of data preprocessing, model selection, training, and evaluation. It includes code cells with explanations and visualizations to provide insights into the model-building steps.
- **`app.py`**: The main application script that contains the code to run the recommendation model and generate song suggestions. This script is designed for production environments and can be easily integrated into larger applications.

## Features
- **Data Processing**: Cleans and preprocesses song data, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing data where necessary.
- **Model Training**: Leverages collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or a hybrid approach to create an accurate recommendation model.
- **Interactive Recommendations**: Generates music recommendations for users based on historical data or specified preferences.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluates model performance using metrics such as RMSE, precision, recall, or others suited to recommendation tasks.

## Requirements
To run this project, install the required Python libraries:

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
pip install spotipy
pip install steamlit

## Usage
Jupyter Notebook: Open model training.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook to explore the step-by-step model development, complete with data exploration, visualizations, and training outputs.
Python Script: Run app.py in a terminal or IDE to start the recommendation system.
bash
Copy code
python app.py
Dataset
The system uses a dataset of songs, encompassing attributes such as genre, artist, album, user ratings, and play counts to personalize recommendations effectively.

## How It Works
**Data Preprocessing**: Data is cleaned, encoded, and normalized to ensure quality input for the model.
**Model Training**: The chosen model is trained on user interaction data to predict user preferences.
**Recommendation Generation**: For a given user's listening history, the model suggests songs that align with their taste.
**Evaluation**: Model performance is tested and fine-tuned to optimize recommendation accuracy.
**Streamlit Interface**: The frontend hosted on Streamlit enables easy access to recommendations and enhances user interaction.
